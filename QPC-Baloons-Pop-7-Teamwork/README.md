Basic implementation of baloons game.
 
Randomly generated baloons with colours(numbers) are placed into a matrix. By choosing row and column the user
determines which baloon to pop. If its neighbours are from the same colour(same number) all of them are poped.
the game finishes when the user pops all the baloons.
